# About these documents

This document contains the **worked-out answers** to all assignments.  

- The text is **identical** to the student version: introductions, task descriptions, and story-like explanations are the same.  
- The **only difference** is that the code blocks are **filled in with solutions** instead of hints.  
- Outputs (tables, plots) are also shown so you can check your own results.  

# How to use the answers

We strongly recommend:

1. **First try the assignments yourself.**  
   Use the hints and explanations in the student versions.  

2. **Only consult these answers afterwards,** to check your solutions, compare approaches, or get unstuck.  

3. Treat this document as a **learning aid, not a shortcut**. The real value comes from struggling with the exercises before reading the solutions.  

# Final remark

Keep both the assignments and the answer key. Together, they provide you with a **mini reference manual** for common R workflows and analyses that you can revisit later during your PhD.
